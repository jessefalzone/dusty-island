          <dt>What is the purpose of this site?</dt>
          <dd>
            This is my personal site where I can store my ramblings. It's
            inspired by the early ideals of the World Wide Web in which anyone
            could join the level playing field and have their voice heard.

          <dt>What JavaScript framework did you use to build it?</dt>
          <dd>
            Uhh... none! This is a static site, and I wanted to keep it small
            and snappy. It's just a small amount of HTML and CSS. I believe
            strongly in using the right tool for the job. Plus, I love how
            quickly HTML-only sites load. :)
