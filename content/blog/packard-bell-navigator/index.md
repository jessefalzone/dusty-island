Although I've been mostly avoiding OpenAI lately, I recently asked ChatGPT to
help recover my dwindling memory of a computer "game" that I used to play as a
stupid little kid. I couldn't remember the name of it. All I knew was that it
came installed (bloatware!) on our old Packard Bell running Windows 95, and it
was a virtual house in which you could go to different rooms and open various
programs and utilities. [Skeuomorphism](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/skeuomorphism) at its finest.

ChatGPT:

> It sounds like you're describing Microsoft Bob!

Wrong!

But I can see why it thought that. What I was actually looking for was
Packard Bell Navigator 3.9, an alternative user interface for Windows meant to help
a new user learn how to operate a GUI and launch programs. Apparently it
was more intuitive to think of the operating system as a house. Want to send a
fax? Then go into the virtual office and click the fax machine. Are you a kid?
Go into the kid's room to look for a game to play. I don't recall there being a kitchen.

How cool is this house? I would totally live there, especially in this housing
market. The general consensus, from what I can tell, is that Navigator
was not that fun to use, but I really loved it. I'd spend hours exploring the house
and clicking on the Internet globe, not knowing that we didn't yet have an
internet connection.

## Bob

Microsoft loved it too -- so much so that they copied it,
poorly, and released their own version called Microsoft Bob.

Just look at this mustard monstrosity:

Microsoft, with all its anti-competitive prowess, apparently forced Packard Bell
to ship with Bob instead of Navigator, and then due to poor reception (gosh I
wonder why?) they killed Bob altogether after less than a year.

## So What?

I miss the kind of software experience that Navigator offered. I'll chalk some
of it up to nostalgia and the
