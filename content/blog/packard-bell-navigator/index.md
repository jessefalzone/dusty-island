Although I've been trying to avoid OpenAI lately, I asked ChatGPT to help
recover my dwindling memory of a computer "game" that I used to play as a stupid
little kid. I couldn't remember the name of it but I knew that it came installed
(bloatware) on our old Packard Bell running Windows 95, and that it was a
virtual house in which you could go to different rooms and open various programs
and utilities.
[Skeuomorphism](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/skeuomorphism)
at its finest.

ChatGPT:

> It sounds like you're describing Microsoft Bob!

Wrong!

But I can see why it thought that. What I was actually looking for was Packard
Bell Navigator 3.9, an alternative Windows user interface from 1993 that was
meant to help a novice learn how to operate the GUI and launch programs. The
idea was that it would be more intuitive to think of the operating system as
a house. Want to send a fax? Then go into the virtual office and click the fax
machine. Are you a kid? Go into the kid's room to look for a game to play.
Hungry? I don't recall there being a kitchen.

How cool is this house? I would totally live there, especially in this housing
market. The general consensus, from what I can tell, is that Navigator was not
that fun to use, but I really loved it. I'd spend hours exploring the house and
clicking on the Internet globe, unaware that we didn't yet have an internet
connection. It was a treat to go into the library and explore [Microsoft
Encarta](https://youtu.be/4hoGKOe2xyc?feature=shared).

## Microsoft Bob

Microsoft loved Navigator too -- so much so that they copied it, poorly, and
released their own version called Microsoft Bob.

Just look at this mustard monstrosity:

) }}

Microsoft, with all its anti-competitive prowess, apparently forced Packard Bell
to ship with Bob instead of Navigator. Due to poor reception (gee I wonder why?)
they killed Bob altogether after less than a year.

## I Will End With a Rant

I miss the approach to software that Navigator offered. I'll chalk some of it up
to nostalgia and how every novel experience as a kid was the most incredible
thing ever, but there was a certain Fun Factor to that era of computing -- even
in software aimed primarily at adults -- that I feel is missing nowadays. Why
does every UI look basically the same? Where is the creativity?

Enter a system like Material Design where the goal is to make the design process
as fast a possible at the expense of creativity and,
[arguably](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22481602), quality. It's the
same reason why over the last ten years humanity has [produced more
plastic](https://plasticoceans.org/the-facts/) than the entire century before,
or why Levi's jeans are now crap: we like cheap junk. (More accurately,
corporations have learned that they can make more money for their shareholders
if they churn out garbage. But I digress.)

Now that everyone knows how to use a computer we don't need metaphors for the
physical world to help explain a UI, but that doesn't mean we _can't_ have them.
Not to mention I often find flat, minimalist designs that are a nightmare to
use. (Where exactly do I click? Is this item selected?) Navigator, and even
somewhat more recent operating systems like iOS 6, had a quality of comfort and
familiarity because they had realism and depth. And that is what generates
nostalgia. Will anyone ever be nostalgic for Android 14 or iOS 17? We'll see.
