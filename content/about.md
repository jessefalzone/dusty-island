Aloha! On this page you can learn a bit more about me and how I've configured
jesse.cafe.

## About This Site

This site is my tiny contribution to the free and open internet.

### Technical

I built it with a Rust library called [Zola](https://getzola.org) and it is
hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). My goal is to make
each page as small and fast as possible. There are no CSS libraries, just
minimal styling that I wrote myself.

There is no JavaScript _except_ for a small snippet on the
[Contact](@/contact.md) page that hides my email address from bots. Feel free to
disable JavaScript!

While building this I did my best to adhere to best practices and respect
visitors. There are always improvements to be made but here are some positives:

- It's
  [fast](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-jesse-cafe/w4vhakv0yw?form_factor=desktop).
- The carbon footprint is low.

- There are no
  [trackers](https://themarkup.org/blacklight?url=jesse.cafe&device=desktop&location=us&force=false)
  or cookies.
- The necessary [security
  headers](https://securityheaders.com/?q=jesse.cafe&followRedirects=on) are
  included.

### Styling and Other Choices

I chose the `.cafe` top-level domain to reflect the early internet's utopian
ideals of community, accessibility, and the free exchange of ideas. Also I like
coffee.

The favicon (below) is a desktop. I use this site as a creative outlet, and I
have a similar lamp on my desk, so I thought it was fitting.

<img src="/icon.svg" alt="This site's favicon, a desktop icon."
width="128" height="128" class="img--plain">

The color scheme is loosely based on [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/)
(especially dark mode). Light/dark mode follows your system preference.

The font stack for normal text is `'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode',
  'Lucida Sans', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif`. On most Macs and PCs you'll see
one of the Lucida variations. I think Lucida Grande is readable and elicits fun
memories of computing; it was the system font on macOS from 1999 to 2014.
Monospace fonts are `'Lucida Console', Menlo, Monaco, monospace`. There
are no external fonts that would slow down loading.

### Interests

I'm a curious person by nature so I have lots of interests. Here are a few:

- 90s computing (e.g. Windows 95)
- Traditional hand-tool woodworking
- Semantic HTML
- Exploring old graveyards
- Environmental protection
- Watches
- Various [90s aesthetics](https://www.are.na/evan-collins-1522646491/channels)
- Baking bread and pizza
- The ocean
- [Solar power](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/)
- German beer
- Hiking

Maybe someday I'll blog about those.
