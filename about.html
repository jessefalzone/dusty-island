        <p>You want to know more, huh?</p>
        <h4 id="#career">My Career, So Far</h4>
        <p>
          I've been a web developer for the past 10 years. My focus has been
          front-end development, but mostly recently I was Director of
          [Full-Stack] Application Development and then CTO.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those were valuable roles and great learning experiences. I questiond
          a lot of it: How do I get people to enjoy standup meetings and update
          their tickets? What the heck are my DevOps engineers doing? How do I
          manage these people and these budgets? Do I even want to?
        </p>
        <p>
          It took me a while to answer that last question but eventually it
          became a clear, "No". I was burned out. I realized I needed to go back
          to getting my hands dirty building cool things (both virtual and real)
          in a more creative space.
