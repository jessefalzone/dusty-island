        <content type="html" xml:base="https://jesse.cafe/blog/packard-bell-navigator/">&lt;p&gt;Although I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid OpenAI lately, I recently asked ChatGPT to
help recover my dwindling memory of a computer &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; that I used to play as a
stupid little kid. I couldn&#x27;t remember the name of it. All I knew was that it
came installed (bloatware) on our old Packard Bell running Windows 95 and that
it was a virtual house in which you could go to different rooms and open various
programs and utilities.
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.interaction-design.org&#x2F;literature&#x2F;topics&#x2F;skeuomorphism&quot;&gt;Skeuomorphism&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
at its finest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you&#x27;re describing Microsoft Bob!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can see why it thought that. What I was actually looking for was Packard
Bell Navigator 3.9, an alternative Windows user interface from 1993 that was
meant to help a novice learn how to operate the GUI and launch programs. The
thought was that it would be more intuitive to think of the operating system as
a house. Want to send a fax? Then go into the virtual office and click the fax
machine. Are you a kid? Go into the kid&#x27;s room to look for a game to play.
Hungry? I don&#x27;t recall there being a kitchen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How cool is this house? I would totally live there, especially in this housing
market. The general consensus, from what I can tell, is that Navigator was not
that fun to use, but I really loved it. I&#x27;d spend hours exploring the house and
clicking on the Internet globe, unaware that we didn&#x27;t yet have an internet
connection. It was a treat to go into the library and explore &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;4hoGKOe2xyc?feature=shared&quot;&gt;Microsoft
Encarta&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Microsoft Bob&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft loved Navigator too -- so much so that they copied it, poorly, and
released their own version called Microsoft Bob.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at this mustard monstrosity:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, with all its anti-competitive prowess, apparently forced Packard Bell
to ship with Bob instead of Navigator. Due to poor reception (gee I wonder why?)
they killed Bob altogether after less than a year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

I Will End With a Rant&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss the approach to software that Navigator offered. I&#x27;ll chalk some of it up
to nostalgia and how every novel experience as a kid was the most incredible
thing ever, but there was a certain Fun Factor to that era of computing -- even
in software aimed primarily at adults -- that I feel is missing nowadays. Why
does every UI look basically the same? Where is the creativity?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter a system like Material Design where the goal is to make the design process
as fast a possible at the expense of creativity and,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22481602&quot;&gt;arguably&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, quality. It&#x27;s the
same reason why over the last ten years humanity has &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plasticoceans.org&#x2F;the-facts&#x2F;&quot;&gt;produced more
plastic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; than the entire century before,
or why Levi&#x27;s jeans are now crap: we like cheap junk. (More accurately,
corporations have learned that they can make more money for their shareholders
if they churn out garbage. But I digress.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that everyone knows how to use a computer we don&#x27;t need metaphors for the
physical world to help explain a UI, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we &lt;em&gt;can&#x27;t&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; have them.
Not to mention I often find flat, minimalist designs that are a nightmare to
use. (Where exactly do I click? Is this item selected?) Navigator, and even
somewhat more recent operating systems like iOS 6, had a quality of comfort and
familiarity because they had realism and depth. For me, that&#x27;s what generates
nostalgia. Will anyone ever be nostalgic for Android 14 or iOS 17? We&#x27;ll see.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
