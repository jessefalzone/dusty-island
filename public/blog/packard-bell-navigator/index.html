I couldn't remember the name of it. All I knew was that it came installed (bloatware) on our old Packard Bell running Windows 95 and that it was a virtual house in which you could go to different rooms and open various programs and utilities. <a href=https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/skeuomorphism>Skeuomorphism</a> at its finest.<p>ChatGPT:<blockquote><p>It sounds like you're describing Microsoft Bob!</blockquote><p>Wrong!<p>But I can see why it thought that. What I was actually looking for was Packard Bell Navigator 3.9, an alternative Windows user interface from 1993 that was meant to help a novice learn how to operate the GUI and launch programs. The thought was that it would be more intuitive to think of the operating system as a house. Want to send a fax? Then go into the virtual office and click the fax machine. Are you a kid? Go into the kid's room to look for a game to play. Hungry? I don't recall there being a kitchen.<figure class=post-figure><a href=https://jesse.cafe/processed_images/navigator.0c3ad3c1d26a51b0.png> <img alt="Packard Bell Navigator's living room" title="Packard Bell Navigator's living room.

I would totally live there, especially in this housing market. The general consensus, from what I can tell, is that Navigator was not that fun to use, but I really loved it. I'd spend hours exploring the house and clicking on the Internet globe, unaware that we didn't yet have an internet connection. It was a treat to go into the library and explore <a href="https://youtu.be/4hoGKOe2xyc?feature=shared">Microsoft Encarta</a>.<h2 id=microsoft-bob><a aria-label="Anchor link for: microsoft-bob" href=#microsoft-bob>#</a> Microsoft Bob</h2><p>Microsoft loved Navigator too -- so much so that they copied it, poorly, and released their own version called Microsoft Bob.<p>Just look at this mustard monstrosity:<figure class=post-figure><a href=https://jesse.cafe/processed_images/bob.6d91966cbba7956d.jpg> <img alt="Microsoft Bob's living room" title="Microsoft Bob's living room." height=300 src=https://jesse.cafe/processed_images/bob.c11fddf9089b3e7e.webp width=400> </a><br><figcaption>Microsoft Bob's living room.</figcaption> / <cite>Credit: <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/programwitch/248234802>K. Latham</a></cite></figure><p>Microsoft, with all its anti-competitive prowess, apparently forced Packard Bell to ship with Bob instead of Navigator. Due to poor reception (gee I wonder why?) they killed Bob altogether after less than a year.<h2 id=i-will-end-with-a-rant><a aria-label="Anchor link for: i-will-end-with-a-rant" href=#i-will-end-with-a-rant>#</a> I Will End With a Rant</h2><p>I miss the approach to software that Navigator offered. I'll chalk some of it up to nostalgia and how every novel experience as a kid was the most incredible thing ever, but there was a certain Fun Factor to that era of computing -- even in software aimed primarily at adults -- that I feel is missing nowadays. Why does every UI look basically the same? Where is the creativity?<p>Enter a system like Material Design where the goal is to make the design process as fast a possible at the expense of creativity and, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22481602">arguably</a>, quality. It's the same reason why over the last ten years humanity has <a href=https://plasticoceans.org/the-facts/>produced more plastic</a> than the entire century before, or why Levi's jeans are now crap: we like cheap junk. (More accurately, corporations have learned that they can make more money for their shareholders if they churn out garbage. But I digress.)<p>Now that everyone knows how to use a computer we don't need metaphors for the physical world to help explain a UI, but that doesn't mean we <em>can't</em> have them. Not to mention I often find flat, minimalist designs that are a nightmare to use. (Where exactly do I click? Is this item selected?) Navigator, and even somewhat more recent operating systems like iOS 6, had a quality of comfort and familiarity because they had realism and depth. For me, that's what generates nostalgia. Will anyone ever be nostalgic for Android 14 or iOS 17? We'll see.</article></main><hr><footer><pre>
