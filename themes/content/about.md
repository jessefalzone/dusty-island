I'm a curious person by nature so I have lots of weird interests. Here
are a few:

- Traditional handtool woodworking
- Exploring old graveyards
- Colonial America
- Environmental protection
- 90s computing (e.g. Windows 95)
- [The Global Village Coffeehouse aesthetic](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Global_Village_Coffeehouse#Gallery)
- Baking yeasted breads (especially soft pretzels)
- The ocean
- Diver's watches
- [Solar power](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/)
- German beer
- Hiking

Maybe someday I'll blog about those.
